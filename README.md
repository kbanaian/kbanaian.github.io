I am a professor of [economics](https://www.stcloudstate.edu/economics/default.aspx) in the [Herberger Business School](https://www.stcloudstate.edu/hbs/) at [St. Cloud State University](https://www.stcloudstate.edu/). I direct the university's [Center for Policy Research and Community Engagement](https://www.stcloudstate.edu/CPRCE).

My main work since 2004 has focused on the St. Cloud economy. You can find all past issues of the _St. Cloud Area Quarterly Business Report_ here in the [SCSU Repository](http://repository.stcloudstate.edu/scqbr).
